Character name: Vivienne Starling
Response: Detective, I assure you, my evening was tragically dull compared to what followed. After dinner, I retired early—Reginald and I had exchanged rather…heated words, and I thought it best not to linger. I entered my bedroom just before midnight; young Elsie saw me, I believe. I began undressing, brushing my hair. There was a storm—you must have heard it, rattling the windows terribly. I heard Reginald’s study door slam at some point, but paid it little mind. As for others, Charles Blackwood was lingering in the hall after supper, muttering to himself. Eleanor appeared anxious, pacing outside her room. And the doctor—Dr. Mallory—was nowhere to be seen for quite some time. I heard footsteps, but with these old floorboards, who can say from where? I did not leave my room…until the commotion began. If you’re suggesting otherwise, I hope you have more than wild suspicion.
